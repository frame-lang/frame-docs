Frame Docs v0.11 â€“ *main* branch
============================

Welcome! Here you will find the official documentation for the **Frame Language**.

What is Frame?
--------------
Frame is a "metaprogramming" language for both designing and programming state machines (technically Turning Machines). 
Frame is a "metaprogramming" language in the sense that Frame programs are intended to be transpiled to other languages
as well as into documentation. Currently Frame supports Python as its only target language and Statechart visual notation 
for documentation. 

In the future Frame will expand its target language set beyond Python to include JavaScript, Java, C#, C++, Golang and Rust. Other languages 
will follow as the project gains support and adoption.
