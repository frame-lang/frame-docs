Intermediate Frame
==================

Frame's syntax is inspired by and supports key concepts from Statecharts, a state machine visual
language invented by Dr. David Harel in his
`1987 paper <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0167642387900359>`_.
Statechart notation is used in both UML software
modeling and the SYSML systems modeling languages as the standard flavor of
state machine visual languages.
