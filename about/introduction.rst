Getting Started With Frame
==========================

Frame provides a small but growing ecosystem of tools for developers interested in learning about and utilizing 
Frame in their projects. 


The Framepiler CLI Tool 
-----------------------

Central to Frame development is the Frame transpiler (the Framepiler). The Framepiler is an open source MIT 
licensed CLI tool that turns Frame "specs" into UML or code. 
It is written in Rust and is straightforward to modify to add new target outputs for documentation and source code generation. 
You can read more, view the code and download the Framepiler from `GitHub <https://github.com/frame-lang/frame_transpiler>`_.

The Frame Playground
---------------------

For those wanting to dive right in, or just experiment online, Frame provides an online `playground <https://playground.frame-lang.org>`_.


VSCode Extension
--------------

Frame provides a VSCode extension. To install it, download VSCode and under the extensions menu item search for 
**Frame System Designer**.
